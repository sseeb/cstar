## Structure

- scripts are placed in `code`.

- datasets in `data`

- documentation in `docs`

## Goals

- Familiarize ourselves with GitHub
  - Always use `git pull` before you start working;
  - `git pull --rebase` may be helpful on solving conflicts.

- Coding style: we should probably follow similar conventions to make it easier
  for others to read our code.

- Discuss the repository structure. Some of the options are: 
  - Working on separate scripts (pros: avoids conflicts; cons: it makes it
    harder to organize the repo.)


## R as a GIS

`sf`, `terra`, `raster`, `tmap`, `mapview`, `leaflet`, `ggplot2`, `arrow` and
  `geoarrow`

- Coordinate Reference System

- Example of reading the data and "turning it into a spatial dataset"

### General Effort Protocols

Observers are always on effort when ship moving at 5+ knots and weather permits
(on all transits, both on and off transect). There should always be 2 observers
present. Observations should begin as soon as the ship has left
station. Observer on port side scans from bow to 90 degrees left, from ship to
horizon. Observer on starboard side scans from bow to 90 degrees right, from
ship to horizon. Binoculars should be used for scanning approximately half of
the time to scan from ship to horizon. Observations occur until Beaufort 6,
rain, or fog reduces visibility to 0.5 nmi or less. While off effort due to
weather, at least one observer watches for changes in weather and opportunistic
sightings.

### Sightings Protocols

Sighting numbers are cumulative throughout the cruise. Sightings are considered
on-effort when: 2 observers are present; Beaufort sea state 5 or less,
visibility greater than 0.5 nmi; Ship is traveling along prescribed CalCOFI
trackline; Ship speed is greater than or equal to 5 knots. Species ID may be
confirmed via Big Eyes. Photos of sightings may be taken to verify species ID,
though photo effort should not interfere with visual effort.
