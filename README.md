## General Effort Protocols

Observers are always on effort when ship moving at 5+ knots and weather permits
(on all transits, both on and off transect). There should always be 2 observers
present. Observations should begin as soon as the ship has left
station. Observer on port side scans from bow to 90 degrees left, from ship to
horizon. Observer on starboard side scans from bow to 90 degrees right, from
ship to horizon. Binoculars should be used for scanning approximately half of
the time to scan from ship to horizon. Observations occur until Beaufort 6,
rain, or fog reduces visibility to 0.5 nmi or less. While off effort due to
weather, at least one observer watches for changes in weather and opportunistic
sightings.

## Sightings Protocols

Sighting numbers are cumulative throughout the cruise. Sightings are considered
on-effort when: 2 observers are present; Beaufort sea state 5 or less,
visibility greater than 0.5 nmi; Ship is traveling along prescribed CalCOFI
trackline; Ship speed is greater than or equal to 5 knots. Species ID may be
confirmed via Big Eyes. Photos of sightings may be taken to verify species ID,
though photo effort should not interfere with visual effort.
